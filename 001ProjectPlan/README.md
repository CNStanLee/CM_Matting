# Project Plan
Group Name and Membership
Roles of everyone in the group[algorithms, i/o, testing]. In real life you might not have someone in the group who is good enough at the Math or the I/o or the testing. So, seek out a “consultant” who can help you with key bits. They may be from another group or a demonstrator. Declare who that was.
Describe the key mathematical steps in easy-to-understand terms 
Show how that leads to a flow diagram of the implementation
Present a plan showing the core algorithmic functions and who will implement them. Stage the development . E.g., Matlab first then Python
Define an e2e test and how it will be implemented
Define unit tests for your core functionality (a small number .. 3 of them say)
Declare some milestones and timeline
